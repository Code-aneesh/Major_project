## Detailed Setup Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This creates an isolated Python environment to avoid package conflicts.

### 2. Dataset Organization
Place your ultrasound images in the following structure:
```
datasets/
├── mendeley_data/
│   └── images/          # Raw ultrasound images
├── processed_data/      # Will contain processed annotations
└── yolo_dataset/       # Will contain YOLO format data
```

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline

#### Step 1: Filter Annotations
```bash
python scripts/filter_annotations.py
```
This script:
- Reads raw ultrasound images
- Verifies landmark points using intensity analysis
- Removes unclear or incorrect annotations
- Creates filtered_annotations.csv with verified data
- Processing time: ~5-10 minutes depending on dataset size

#### Step 2: YOLO Dataset Preparation
```bash
python scripts/prepare_yolo_dataset.py
```
This script:
- Converts point annotations to bounding boxes
- Normalizes coordinates (0-1 range)
- Splits data (70% train, 15% val, 15% test)
- Creates YOLO format labels
- Processing time: ~3-5 minutes

### 4. Training Process

#### Initial Training
```bash
python scripts/train_improved.py
```

**What happens during training:**
1. **Data Loading**
   - Loads preprocessed images
   - Applies real-time augmentation
   - Creates training batches

2. **Training Loop**
   - Epochs: 100 iterations through data
   - Each epoch:
     * Forward pass (prediction)
     * Loss calculation
     * Backward pass (learning)
     * Weight updates

3. **Monitoring**
   - Loss values displayed every epoch
   - Validation performed every 10 epochs
   - Best model saved automatically
   - Training time: 2-3 hours (GPU) or 8-12 hours (CPU)

### 5. Model Validation
```bash
python scripts/validate_model.py
```

**Validation Process:**
1. Loads best model from training
2. Runs predictions on validation set
3. Calculates metrics:
   - Precision (accuracy of detections)
   - Recall (percentage of structures found)
   - mAP50 (mean Average Precision)
4. Generates validation plots

### 6. Making Predictions
```bash
python scripts/predict.py
```

**Prediction Process:**
1. Image Preprocessing:
   - Resize to 640x640
   - Enhance contrast using CLAHE
   - Normalize pixel values

2. Detection:
   - Model inference
   - Non-maximum suppression
   - Confidence filtering

3. Output:
   - Visualized image with detections
   - Confidence scores for each structure
   - Coordinates of detected structures

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **GPU Out of Memory**
   ```python
   # Reduce batch size in train_improved.py
   training_args = {
       'batch': 4,  # Reduce from 8
       'imgsz': 512  # Reduce from 640 if needed
   }
   ```

2. **Poor Detection Results**
   - Check image quality
   - Verify correct anatomical view
   - Adjust confidence threshold:
   ```python
   model.predict(conf=0.25)  # Default 0.25, adjust as needed
   ```

3. **Training Issues**
   - Monitor loss curves
   - Check GPU utilization
   - Verify dataset integrity

## Performance Optimization

### For Better Accuracy:
1. Use clear ultrasound images
2. Ensure correct anatomical planes
3. Maintain consistent image quality
4. Use appropriate confidence thresholds

### For Faster Processing:
1. Use GPU acceleration
2. Optimize batch size
3. Consider input image size
4. Enable TensorRT if available
